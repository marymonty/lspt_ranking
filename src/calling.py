"""Module to create and check the Query object.

A class for a Query, used to check that the given query can be made into
a JSON object, and that Falcon can successfully connect to the endpoint for
further computation.

Typical usage example:
    We receive query {query: "where in new york is rpi"}
    this query can be successfully made into a json string
    and even though an n_gram is not included, we can give 
    a default 50 returned results.
